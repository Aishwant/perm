                    <h2>Introduction</h2>
                    <p class="document-paragraph">The topic of our project is "An Overview on United States Permanent Visa Applications". We found this
                        theme relevant to our group because each of us is an international student. Since we attend the university
                        in the United States, we understand the concern of international students about their further employment.
                        We know that some international students are interested in working in the United States after graduating
                        from the university, which requires them to receive some type of permanent work visa. We know from
                        our experience that there is a lot of uncertainty with the application process, especially for visas
                        like H1B, for which the final decision is made based on computer picking certain number of applicants
                        from the pool as a part of so-called “H1B Visa Lottery”. In order to shed some light on the application
                        process we decided to explore the dataset containing application information of permanent visa applicants.
                        Our main goal for the project was to provide insight to potential permanent visa applicants on how
                        likely their application is to be approved given their occupation, country of citizenship and state
                        where they are applying for job, among other attributes.</p>
                    <br>
                    <h2>What is PERM?</h2>
                    <p class="document-paragraph">PERM is the process for obtaining a permanent labor certification, the first step of the green card process
                        for foreign nationals seeking permanent residence through their employment.</p>
                    <p class="document-paragraph">A permanent labor certification issued by the Department of Labor (DOL) allows an employer to hire a
                        foreign worker to work permanently in the United States. In most instances, before the U.S. employer
                        can submit an immigration petition to the Department of Homeland Security's U.S. Citizenship and
                        Immigration Services (USCIS), the employer must obtain a certified labor certification application
                        from the DOL's Employment and Training Administration (ETA). The DOL must certify to the USCIS that
                        there are not sufficient U.S. workers able, willing, qualified and available to accept the job opportunity
                        in the area of intended employment and that employment of the foreign worker will not adversely affect
                        the wages and working conditions of similarly employed U.S. workers.</p>
                    <br>
                    <h2>Data Abstraction</h2>
                    <p class="document-paragraph">Our
                        <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/jboysen/us-perm-visas" class="link-black" target="_blank">dataset</a> is a 2-dimensional table consisting of permanent visa application information. Initially
                        it had 156 attributes, 374 thousand items and had size of about 300 megabytes. We chose 21 attribute
                        of interest and normalized field values. Empty fields are kept and included during data processing
                        and derivation. Among these attributes there are quantitative as well as categorical attributes.</p>
                    <p class="document-paragraph">
                        A description of the main attributes are available
                        <a href="index.html#dataset" class="link-black" target="_blank">here</a>.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <h2>Task Abstraction</h2>
                    <p class="document-paragraph">The main goals of our project was to
                        <strong>analyze</strong> and
                        <strong>discover</strong>. The outcomes we were looking for was generating new hypotheses about permanent
                        visa applications as well as testing some of our own beliefs about the process. For instance, we
                        were interested whether IT sector is really comprising the majority of applications, which country
                        has the most people applying and so on.
                    </p>
                    <p class="document-paragraph">The users of our visualisation can search for information in a variety of ways:
                        <strong>lookup and compare</strong> acceptance rate of a particular country or state on the map,
                        <strong>locate</strong> which country has the longest processing time, locate the top demanded job within
                        a state,
                        <strong>discover</strong> a trend in major occupation groups over the year,
                        <strong>explore</strong> the occupation hierarchical order and locate the the highest certified visa types.</p>
                    <br>
                    <h2>Implementation</h2>
                    <p class="document-paragraph">We used D3.js for all of our visualisations on a website built using Bootstrap. We added a story element
                        to our website. Starting from top to the bottom, the text guides the user through our visualizations,
                        explaining how to interact with the visualizations and highlighting some of the interesting facts
                        that we noticed that the user can start his or her exploration from.</p>

                                The map provides 2 color scales based on 2 factors: the total number of certified cases and
                                the certifed percentage in each country. When user hovers on a country, it will show the
                                detailed info of that country, regarding certified percentage, total certified, certified-expired,

                                We used D3.js for making this interactive map. The map was solely build upon javascript. The data for each coordinates were
                                imported from a package but further implementation was written by our team. The states were
                                colored based on two factors: the total number of certified cases and the certified percentage
                                in each state. The colors were given by using the quantile scale based on 9 bins. The states,
                                when clicked, zoom in and open up a modal which displays a bar graph and an option to chose
                                another state for comparison. The comparison is done based on number of certified, denied,
                                withdrawal and certified-expired cases of that state to the the state the user chooses. Regarding
                                the data, the data for the graph is imported from our csv file, which has the state and corresponding
                                values of the categories. The x-axis consist of the categories and the y-axis has either
                                number scale or percentage scale based on the user chosen input. The difficult part for this
                                part of the program was mainly displaying the values based on the user selected states and
                                getting the graph to update on each interactions. The data imported for the coordinates had
                                different ids assigned to it which was not there in our files so we manually had to hard
                                code the ids in order for the map and the modal to work. In addition, refreshing the graphs
                                and the maps on selection was difficult at start until one of our teammates figure out the
                                solution by removing the graph and calling the methods to add a new one.

                                This particular approach was taken so that user could clearly see the acceptance rate from the map rather than using different
                                graphs for all 50 states. Moreover, users are able to compare when they interact with each
                                state.

                                We chose streamgraph as one of the visualisations for our dataset because the way it represents information can provide user
                                with important insights about timing of applications as well as proportions of applications
                                at certain times. Our streamgraph shows application decision time (month and year) on X-axis
                                and the number of certified cases for various occupation groups of Y-axis. For instance,
                                user can learn what proportion of applications for his or her economic sector of interest
                                was on a given month/year. This information is important to the process of visa application
                                because in order to be certified your job title must be in scarcity inside the US. For instance,
                                looking at “Computer and Mathematical Occupations” we can see that they comprise almost half
                                of all certified application at all times. The fact that such a large amount gets certified
                                means that there is a shortage of workers in this area in the US. Another useful insight
                                that user can learn from this graph is what times of the year most application decisions
                                are issued. This will give user some idea of when to expect the decision and plan other paperworks
                                around it.

                                In order to explore all occupations, we have decided to use a treemap as it can be beneficial in providing an effective hierarchical
                                view of our large occupation data (23 major groups, 96 minor groups and a total of 821 detailed
                                occupations). We provide the option for user to view the occupations treemap with 3 different
                                criteria: total number of cases, total number of certified cases and total annual wage (all
                                for each job group and detailed job). We first have to process our data to create a json
                                file to be used for the visualizations. The "Major Occupation Group" colors of the treemap
                                are the same as those in the stream graph, which makes it easy for users to reference. Using
                                this visualization, users can explore the hierarchy of all occupations (from major groups
                                to minor groups to detailed jobs), and see the distribution of each occupations in terms
                                of the criteria they choose. Furthermore, they can discover patterns within the treemap.
                                For example, we see that even though "Architecture and Engineering Occupations", "Management
                                Occupations" and "Business & Financial Occupations" all have higher numbers of certified
                                cases, "Healthcare Practitioners and Technical Occupations" account for a much larger amount
                                of annual wage (double the amount of Management Occupations which come right after it). This
                                suggests that healthcare occupations may not be highly demanded as engineering, management
                                and business jobs. However, healthcare occupations get paid much more.

                                Through out our whole project, we're constantly trying our different visualisation to see which would best fit our purpose
                                of visualizing a large amount items (country, state, job and visa type in particular). We
                                feel like this bar chart serves the purpose really well for a couple reasons. First, users
                                have the option to adjust their view with the brush, choosing how large their view of the
                                chart is and what section of the chart to be viewed. Second, all items are ordered by descending
                                values, making it easy for users to make comparison. Therefore, we use this bar chart through
                                out our whole project to visualize many data files that are relatively difficult to be visualized
                                in a pretty way, such as all countries' average processing time, each state's top major job
                                group with the highest to lowest number of certified cases, as well as the certified/denied

                                We choose to include story telling/narrative in our visualizations. We believe it would help users to understand the project,
                                what questions we're trying to answer, the context of our visualizations as well as how to
                                interact with them and make their own discover. During the process of putting everything
                                together, all visualizations are reviewed, improved in terms of styling, coloring, positioning
                                and, correctness and added interactivity through tooltips, radio buttons and dropdown boxes.

                    <h2>Challenges</h2>
                    <p class="document-paragraph">
                        The biggest challenge we faced is definitely using D3.js for all our visualizations. It's very challenging to create one
                        D3.js visualization, yet having to add tooltip, transition, interaction and making them all present
                        in one single html page is much more difficult. On the other hand, we definitely learned a lot about
                        D3.js as well as about Javascript and data visualization concepts.
                    </p>
                    <p class="document-paragraph">
                        Other challenges included dealing with the dataset and choosing what and how to visualize. Our dataset is pretty big and
                        contains many inconsistencies in the values of attributes. In order for the website to run fast,
                        we have to pre-process our data and create many individually smaller files to be used for each visualization.
                        We also need to understand every column in the dataset because it is a new and complicated subject
                        to all of us.
                    </p>
                    <p class="document-paragraph">
                        I believed our group has worked well together in embracing the challenges and helping each other find the solutions to those
                        challenges.

                    <h2>Validation</h2>
                    <p class="document-paragraph">
                        For the validation of visuals we made sure we followed principles of good visualization as much as possible. For example,
                        our maps and graphs use color scheme that depends solely on color saturation/lightness, which allows
                        it to be readable by most people with color deficiency. In case of the streamgraph, we used a tooltip,
                        that makes it possible to understand the visualisation without depending on colors. In our number
                        based map we grouped countries by bins based on population to ensure even use of color range between
                        countries with high and low population. For the validation of how well our visuals reflect reality
                        we showed them to Brandon S. McLeod, International Programs Advisor at the University of Mississippi.
                        Mr. McLeod gave us further insight on the nature of our dataset. He said that all of our information
                        is from two public access forms 9035 and 9089. These forms are made public for various purposes,
                        mainly to prevent foreign workers from accepting lower wages and therefore bringing down the wages
                        offered to American workers. Mr.McLeod could not comment on all aspects of our visualizations because
                        he only sees the process from the perspective of applicant and oversees process in the public university
                        which has some exceptions from the general procedure. However, he is aware of some trends of the
                        process for industry as well and here are his notable comments about our visualisations:

                            <h4>Stream Graph</h4>
                            <p class="document-paragraph">
                                On our streamgraph you can see that each year the total number of applications increases, and last year observed is nearly
                                triple the first year. Mr. McLeod confirmed the general trend of increase in number of applications,
                                but mentioned that incline was not as dramatic as in our visualisation. Our hypothesis explaining
                                this phenomenon is that since our dataset was compiled from the pubic reports from multiple
                                years, each year there was different amount of public records released. For our future work
                                we need to test this hypothesis. Also on our streamgraph you can see that Computer and Mathematical
                                occupations take up nearly half of total applications. Mr.McLeod confirmed that his is indeed
                                a trend in industry, however, in universities the applications are more evenly spread out
                                between different categories. There was one more surprising observation in our dataset. As
                                you can see on streamgraph, for years 2013-2016 the time application decisions are made is
                                from April (Application process starts on April 1st) through the end of the year. However,
                                application decisions for year 2012 go from November through March. Mr.McLeod talked to his
                                colleagues but was not able to explain this phenomenon. For our future work we need to do
                                further investigation of what was different about application process in year 2012.

                                Mr.McLeod confirmed that California, Washington, New York, New Jersey have the largest amount of applications as shown in
                                our graph. His explanation of it is that these states have highly developed IT industry.
                                He confirmed the observation we made from our world map that India, China and South Korea
                                are leading in the number of applications.

                                Mr.McLeod further explained why on our world map United States have certain number of applications as well. People leaving
                                in US Territories like American Samoa are not US Citizen and have to go through the process
                                of visa applications just like foreigners.

                    <h3>Improvement</h3>
                    <p class="document-paragraph">
                        The first improvement we want to make is updating the data. Our data stops at 12/2016 and we feel like with another year
                        of 2017, we can confirm many trends and potentially discover further patterns. We also would like
                        to create more visualizations since now that we're more comfortable with D3.js, we're confident that
                        we can make improvements by creating visualizations that are more intuitive, contain more information
                        and allow us to deploy deeper into the original dataset of 156 attributes, not just our small files
                        of 22 chosen attributes.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Predictions?</h3>
                    <p class="document-paragraph">
                        One of the ideas that we would like to work on in future is implementation of database and a tool that would allow user to
                        interact more directly with data. This tool would ask user to choose information that applies to
                        him/her like country of origin, job title, offered wage and so on. Then the tool would query our
                        database for the records matching these selections and build a visualisation telling the user how
                        many people like him or her got certified or denied. This tool would not mislead the user by making
                        predictions, but would give user an idea of what his or her chances to be certified are.
                    </p>
                    <h3>AI and Real Time</h3>
                    <p class="document-paragraph">
                        A more ambitious idea would be making the data update in real time and develop an AI model to predict the application outcome
                        from user inputs.
